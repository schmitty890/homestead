## Features
<!-- list any features -->

## Installation
- Fork or clone the GitHub repo to your machine.
- Ensure that you have Node.js, MySQL and Gulp installed on your machine.
- If you have a password that protects your MySQL root user, enter that password in the connection.js file in the cloned repo.
- In your CLI, navigate to the cloned directory. Install the npm dependencies and run gulp.

  `npm install`

  `gulp`


# Linting
Before you push your branch up to the `develop` branch, ensure you lint your code.

run `npm run -s eslint .` this will show if you have any ESLint errors or warnings.
If you have any errors, please fix them. if you have warnings that could slide, push your code up or talk with a team member.

# Development

The command `gulp` will automatically launch the project in google chrome.

The files watched by gulp are the client js and sass files.

Client side js files are located at `public/assets/js/*.js`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.

Sass files are located at `sass/partials/*.scss`. Editing these files and saving will kick off a gulp build and auto refresh your development workspace.

If you're editing any file outside of `public/assets/js` or `sass/partials`, we recommend running `npm run watch`, this runs nodemon, which watches all of our files.


### Branching process


1. Check which branch you're on `git branch`

2. Start on master branch, `git checkout master`

3. Do a `git pull` to get the latest copy of master

4. Create your new branch to code your story, `git checkout -b <branchname>` (Title your branch name the title of the story you're working on, replace spaces with -)

5. Now you're on your own branch. Type `git branch` to see you're on your new branch.

6. Now write your code.

7. Once you're code is done for the story you're working on, add it to your branch and commit it.

8. Type `git status` to see the status of the files you've worked on. (these should be red, because you havent added them yet)

9. To add these files, do a `git add .` to add all files.

10. Type `git status` again, you will now see the files are green, which indicates they have been added to your branch.

11. Now make your commit message that says specifically what code you changed in this story. `git commit -m "your commit message here"`

12. Next, push your code up to the repository, with a `git push origin <branchname>`

13. Once your branch is pushed up, navigate to our repo, and you can see branch under "Your recently pushed branches:". Click on Compare & pull request.

14. Choose the base branch `development` as that will be the branch you merge your branch into. (the development branch will be merged into master twice a day, at 11am and 11pm)

15. On the right hand side, add reviewers to review your pull request. Then click "Create Pull Request"

16. Once your pull request is approved and merged, it will be built out into production during the next build to production. (11am and 11pm is when builds to prod happen)
